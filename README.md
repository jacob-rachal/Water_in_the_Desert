# What in the world is this?

I was approached by Brother Modesto of the Claretian Missionaries (of the Catholic Church), who asked me to make an attention-grabbing website for a rescue mission(?) that he and his fellow siblings in faith had undertaken. Namely, providing for these water cashes that have been set up along the U.S./Mexico border that are used by immigrants crossing over.

Seeing as how I was (and still am) unemployed with not that much actual real-world work experience under my belt, I said I'll do it freely.  This way, I gain industry experience and something else to add onto my portfolio, and Modesto receives the website he wants and a web developer on call.
